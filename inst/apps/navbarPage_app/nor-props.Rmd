<h3>About the Normal Distribution</h3>

- Most important distribution

- Bell-shaped

- Unimodal, with the peak at the center (mean)

- Mean=Median=Mode

- Symmetric around the center (mean)

- Asymptotic tails

- Area under the curve is 1

- Positive for all x

- Shape is dependent on mean, $\mu$ , and standard deviation, $\sigma$

- 68% of the observations are within 1 standard deviation of the mean

- 95% of the observations are within 2 standard deviations of the
  mean

- 99.9% of the observations are within 3 standard deviations of the
  mean
